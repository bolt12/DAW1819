      Armaldo is a bipedal, amphibious <b>Pokémon</b>, somewhat resembling a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp">mantis
        shrimp</a>. It is covered with thick,
      grayish-blue plates.
      There are accents of yellow, black, white, and red throughout its body.
      Its oblong eyes protrude from the sides of its head.
      A black pattern with two red, teardrop-shaped spots covered the center of its head and a yellow lower jaw.
      Three pairs of wing-like appendages extend from the sides of its long, thick neck.
      A plate of armor on its back has four short spikes and two triangular, yellow-rimmed wings extending from
      underneath.
      Its scaled chest and belly are rimmed with yellow lines as well, and there are two large yellow plates in the
      center of its chest.
      Its segmented arms extend from holes in these plates, each with a large, black claw.
      The legs are also segmented, with black knees. A pair of black fins tips its long tail.
      <br><br>
      In ancient times, Armaldo lived on land by the water's-edge, and dived into the ocean to hunt for prey.
      The large wings on its back were used for swimming, while its thick shell protected it from enemy attacks.
      Its strong claws can break stones and punch through a steel slab.
      Furthermore, they can be freely extended or retracted.
      It is considered to be the ancestor of some <em>Bug-type <b>Pokémon</b></em>.
